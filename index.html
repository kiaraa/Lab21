		<h3>Development!</h3>
		<p>
			I like to code, and I'm honestly kind of crushing it right now. The keys to success are: doing bonus work, keeping a personal project, and explaining things to others! I think anyone can be a good developer if they take the time to learn how. My next goal: turn my pet project into a webapp, somehow! I have no idea how to do that, but I bet it's gonna go great :)

		<h3>Cooking!</h3>
		<p>
			I also love cooking and baking! The science behind how to make good food is really interesting. Did you know that if you want your roasted potatoes to turn out extra crispy, you should parboil them in water with a little baking soda added to it? The alkaline environment makes more crispiness happen. Also, because most flavor compounds are oils, and therefore hydrophobic, whenever it's possible you should use infused cream to add flavor to a recipe rather than infused water.

		<h3>Gardening!</h3>
		<p>
			Okay, I have to admit, I'm not very good at this one. Almost everything in my garden is dead right now. However, I'm really interested in learning about and preserving rare cultivars and heirloom varieties. Because these plants are bred in a specific location for generations, they're often uniquely suited to the original place where they were developed. I don't know if they'll make it this year, but right now I'm growing some small muskmelons that were developed on a Ukranian women's commune, meaning they do well in a cool climate with a short growing season.
