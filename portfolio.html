				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://github.com/kiaraa/QKT-Catering">QKT Catering</a>
					<br>
					<p>My Grand Circus midterm project. Working with as a team, we made a POS system for an imaginary catering business. We were the only team to manage to make a working GUI, which was a bonus challenge.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://github.com/kiaraa/tdd_practice">TDD Practice</a>
					<br>
					<p>These are old, but they're a series of excersises done on my own time to get better with Test Driven Development and pair-programming.
